# Generative AI in Copilot Studio helps you and your organization work more efficiently by letting AI handle many tasks automatically. 
Here’s how it works in simple terms:

- **Generative Answers as a Backup:** If your agent (AI assistant) can’t find an answer to a question, it uses generative AI to search through your company’s data (like websites or documents) and create a helpful response on the spot.

- **Add AI to Topics:** You can add special steps in your agent’s conversations where generative AI provides answers, making the agent smarter without extra work from you.

- **Build Agents and Topics Automatically:** Just describe what you want, and Copilot Studio uses AI to create the agent or conversation topics for you—no need to build everything by hand.

- **Easy to Enable:** You turn on these features by going to the Generative AI section in Copilot Studio’s settings.
## In short:
Generative AI in Copilot Studio lets you quickly create smart agents that can answer questions, help employees, and automate tasks, all with less manual setup and more flexibility


# Using generative answers as a fallback in Microsoft Copilot Studio 
means that if your AI agent can’t find an answer in its pre-written topics, it will automatically use AI to search through your chosen data sources (like your website, SharePoint, or uploaded documents) to create a helpful response for the user.

**In simple words:**

Before, if the agent didn’t understand a question, it would just ask the user to rephrase or send them to a live agent after a couple of tries.

Now, with generative answers, if the agent doesn’t know the answer, it uses AI to look up information from sources you’ve picked and gives the user a direct answer—no need to write out every possible question and answer ahead of time.

This makes your agent much more helpful and saves you time because you don’t have to manually create answers for every possible question.

**How it works:**

You enable generative answers in Copilot Studio’s settings.

You add your data sources (like a website, SharePoint, or custom files).

When a user asks something not covered by your topics, the agent uses AI to search these sources and generate a response.

This way, your agent can answer more questions, even if you haven’t planned for them, using the most up-to-date information from your chosen sources.
