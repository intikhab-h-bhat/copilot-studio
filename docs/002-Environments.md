# Working with Environments in Microsoft Copilot Studio (Simple Explanation)
Environments in Microsoft Copilot Studio are like separate “workspaces” where your company’s agents, data, and apps are stored and managed. Each agent you create is saved inside an environment, which helps keep things organized, secure, and tailored to specific needs.

## Why Use Different Environments?
Departmental: Create an environment for each team (like HR, Sales, or Support) so each has its own agents and data.

Regional: Set up environments for different offices or countries to follow local data rules and keep information separate.

Data Privacy: Some countries have strict data storage rules. Separate environments help you meet these requirements.

You can also choose to keep everything in one environment if you don’t need this separation.

## How to Create and Use Environments
First Time: When you first sign in and create an agent, a default environment is created for you automatically.

Add More: If you need more environments (for new teams or regions), create them in the Power Platform admin center—not directly inside Copilot Studio.

Go to the Power Platform admin center.

Click the Environments tab and select New.

Fill in the name, type (production or trial), region, and other details.

Save and refresh to see your new environment.

Switching: You can easily switch between environments in Copilot Studio using the environment switcher at the top menu bar.

## Access and Security
You need the right permissions to create agents in an environment. If you can’t access an environment, ask your system administrator to grant you access.

## Trial Environments
You can create a trial environment to test Copilot Studio. Trial environments last for 30 days and then expire, deleting all agents and data inside.

## Summary:
Environments help you organize and control your agents and data in Copilot Studio. Use them to separate work by team, region, or data privacy needs, and manage them through the Power Platform admin center. You can easily switch between environments as needed
